# ATLAS MC sample production chain: Run 2

This book summaries a complete and comprehensive set of instruction to produce MonteCarlo (MC) samples under the ATLAS experiment (p)Athena framework on the GRID.

In the right you will find a menu with each of the steps, starting for the generation of events.
Passing for the Simulation, Reconstruction and final analysis-format production before to analyze the samples looking for physics!
